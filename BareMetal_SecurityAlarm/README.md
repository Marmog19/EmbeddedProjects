# Security Alarm
This program emulates a simple security system by using an LED as the alarm, 2 buttons as the contact switches to check if the door and window are closed and a toggle switch to turn the system ON and OFF.
Implemented in an STM32 board. Prototyped using a Breadboard.

If the system is ON the program will check if at least one of the buttons is not pressed, in which case it will turn the LED ON.
